News For Me

Summer of 2020 is the longest and a unique summer I(many) have ever witnessed. As we humans are 
asked to stay indoors and cooperate with the respective governments, (at least) I have frequently  
opened my news application to search for the latest information of this pandemic, protests, or other 
heightening news. With this as a daily task, my brother and I realised, we had to type in about the 
progress to search for the news. This led me to work on building an application where while reading 
a news I could add it to my followings and get all the latest updates on those topics at ease.
